Every small business owner knows admin takes up too much time. But most underestimate just how much it costs. Not just in time – in actual money. The cost of manual admin small business owners bear is one of the biggest hidden drains on profitability. Let's make it visible.

## The Admin Cost Calculator

Here's a simple way to calculate what manual admin is really costing you. Grab a pen or open your calculator.

### Step 1: Count Your Admin Hours

Estimate weekly hours spent on these tasks:

- 📧 Responding to enquiries and emails: **___ hours**
- 📞 Answering/returning phone calls: **___ hours**
- 📋 Invoicing and chasing payments: **___ hours**
- 📅 Scheduling and calendar management: **___ hours**
- 📝 Data entry and filing: **___ hours**
- 📊 Reporting and bookkeeping: **___ hours**
- 💬 Social media and reviews: **___ hours**

**Total weekly admin hours: ___ hours**

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost

If you're doing the admin yourself:

- Your effective hourly rate (revenue ÷ working hours): **£___**
- Weekly admin cost = admin hours × your hourly rate: **£___**
- **Annual admin cost = weekly cost × 48 weeks: £___**

If staff are doing the admin:

- Their hourly cost (salary + NI + pension ÷ hours): **£___**
- Weekly admin cost = admin hours × hourly cost: **£___**
- **Annual admin cost = weekly cost × 48 weeks: £___**

## A Worked Example

Let's look at a real scenario – a trades business owner (plumber) doing their own admin:

- Responding to enquiries: **5 hours/week**
- Phone calls: **4 hours/week**
- Invoicing: **3 hours/week**
- Scheduling: **2 hours/week**
- Data entry: **1 hour/week**
- Bookkeeping: **2 hours/week**
- Social/reviews: **1 hour/week**

**Total: 18 hours/week on admin**

Plumber's effective rate: **£60/hour**

Weekly cost: 18 × £60 = **£1,080/week**

**Annual cost: £51,840**

That's over **£50,000 a year** in time that could be spent on billable work. And this doesn't even count the cost of manual admin small business owners miss indirectly – like [missed calls that go to competitors](/blog/your-business-is-missing-30-of-its-calls-heres-what-thats-costing-you) or slow lead responses that lose jobs.

## What Can Actually Be Automated?

Not all admin can (or should) be automated. But a realistic breakdown:

- **Phone handling:** 70–90% automatable with an AI phone agent
- **Enquiry responses:** 80% automatable with AI lead response
- **Invoicing:** 60% automatable with accounting integrations
- **Scheduling:** 90% automatable with calendar AI
- **Data entry:** 80% automatable with workflow tools
- **Bookkeeping:** 50% automatable with AI-powered tools

Conservatively, you could automate **10–12 hours of that 18-hour example**. That's £28,800–£34,560 back in productive time annually.

## The Investment vs. The Return

A typical AI automation package for a small business costs £300–1,000/month. Let's take the high end: £12,000/year.

Against £30,000+ in recovered time and revenue, that's a **2.5x return on investment** – minimum. Most businesses see the ROI within the first month.

## Where to Start

Don't try to automate everything at once. Start with the highest-impact area:

1. **If you're missing calls** → start with an [AI phone agent](/blog/how-ai-phone-agents-work-and-why-your-business-needs-one)
2. **If leads go cold** → start with automated lead response
3. **If admin eats your evenings** → start with scheduling and invoicing automation

The cost of manual admin small business owners carry is real, quantifiable, and fixable. Most just haven't done the maths. Now you have.
